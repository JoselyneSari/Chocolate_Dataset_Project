# üç´ Welcome to my beginner data analysis project, where I explored and visualized chocolate sales across different countries. Using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project performed data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to uncover customer preferences and sales performances.

## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to analyze chocolate product sales by:
 - Cleaning and preprocessing a raw dataset
 - Identifying top-selling products
 - Visualizing chocolate preferences across different countries

## Tools/Libraries
 - Python
 - Pandas (data wrangling)
 - NumPy (numerical operations)
 - Matplotlib and Seaborn (visualizations)

## Data Cleaning
 - Converted Date column to datetime format
 - Removed non-numeric characters from the Amount column and converted it to float for analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis 
 - Identified the top 5 best-selling chocolate products
 - Analyzed chocolate sales by country
 - Created a heatmap to visualize total sales per product across countries.

# Notes:
The dataset appears to be fictional: 
This project uses the Chocolate Sales dataset available on Kaggle:

**This project is primarily for learning purposes (e.g., data cleaning and visualization basics**
